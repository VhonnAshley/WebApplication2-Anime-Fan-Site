		  <h2>Titan</h2>
		  <hr>
		  <p>As the name suggests, titans are enormous in height. Biologically, these creatures somewhat resemble human beings. However, titans possess various deformities such as over/under-sized heads and limbs, large stomachs, or skeletal frames. Despite their large size, titans are unnaturally light. Average humans can lift body parts of titans comfortably. Titans also produce a high amount of heat and control their body temperature through emitting steam. </p>
		  <p>Titans do not require consuming humans to survive, instead they only need to absorb sunlight. Due to their nature of devouring and throwing up humans, it was thought that they did this for sport. Titans also have rapid regenerative abilities allowing them to survive the gravest of injuries such as dismemberment, disemboweling, and decapitation (if their napes are undamaged). A titan can only be killed by attacking their weak point, the back of their neck. There are various titans classified according to their size and abilities. </p>
		  <p>Titans were originally humans known as the subjects of Ymir. Subjects of Ymir are transformed into titans by being injected with Titan spinal fluid. </p>
		  
		  <br>
		  <h3>Pure Titan</h3>
		  <p>Pure titans comprise most of the titans in the Attack on Titan universe. These titans range from 3 meters to 15 meters in height. Pure titans all share a common feature which is their mindless nature to attack and devour any human nearby. They are often used as weapons in war by Marley as well as Eldia in the past. </p>
		 <img src="Titans/pure.jpg" style="width: 45%; float:center-right; display: block;"> 
		 
		  <br>
		  <h3>Abnormal Titan</h3>
		  <p>Abnormal titans are similar to pure titans apart from displaying abnormal behavior. Abnormal titans typically ignore nearby humans and charge to densely populated areas. Other abnormal titans may also display unusual behavior due to being commanded by a human possessing power from the Nine Titans. </p>
		  <img src="Titans/abnormal.jpg" style="width: 45%; float:center-right; display: block;">

		  <h2>The Nine Titans</h2>
		  <hr>
		  <p>These are the nine titan powers passed down from Ymir to a race of humans called the subjects of Ymir for nearly 2000 years. Humans who hold them had the power to transform into the titan they inherited along with its special abilities while retaining their human body and intelligence. They also can access advanced titan abilities such as focusing rapid regeneration and hardening to certain parts of their bodies. Titans of this type include the following: </p>
		  
		  <table style="width: 100%;">
			<tr>
				<th style="width: 20%">Type</th>
				<th style="width: 40%">Abilities</th>
				<th style="width: 40%">Picture</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Founding Titan</td>
				<td>The Founding Titan gives its holder the power to alter the memories of the subjects of Ymir, as well as turn them into titans and control them. However, only inheritors with royal blood can fully access this titan’s power. Without royal blood, the Founding Titan needs to be in contact with a titan who has royal blood to gain full access to their own power.  </td>
				<td><img src="Titans/founding.jpg" style="width: 45%; float:center-right; display: block;"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Beast Titan </td>
				<td>Depending on the inheritor, the Beast Titan gains the characteristics and the abilities of a certain animal. The Beast Titan also excels in long range combat. </td>
				<td><img src="Titans/beast.jpg" style="width: 45%; float:center-right; display: block;"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Attack Titan  </td>
				<td>Along with raw strength, the holder of the Attack Titan gains the memories of past and future inheritors of the Attack Titan.</td>
				<td><img src="Titans/attack.jpg"style="width: 45%; float:center-right; display: block;"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Female Titan </td>
				<td>The Female Titan can summon a horde of pure titans by screaming. It can also harden parts of its body for offensive or defensive purposes. Additionally, it can mimic other titan abilities. </td>
				<td><img src="Titans/female.jpg"style="width: 45%; float:center-right; display: block;"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Armored Titan  </td>
				<td>The Armored Titan possesses hardened skin that acts as armor except in certain areas necessary for movement. It can also harden its hands and feet further. </td>
				<td><img src="Titans/armored.jpg"style="width: 45%; float:center-right; display: block;"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Colossal Titan </td>
				<td>Standing at 60 meters tall, the Colossal Titan is a weapon of mass destruction. The Colossal Titan can emit high amounts of steam at the cost of its muscle tissue. Its transformation is explosive, and the transformation’s power as well as its blast radius can be controlled by the inheritor. </td>
				<td><img src="Titans/colossal.jpg"style="width: 45%; float:center-right; display: block;"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Jaw Titan  </td>
				<td>In terms of height, the Jaw Titan is on the smaller side. It is the swiftest among the Nine Titans and has sharp, hardened teeth and claws capable of destroying almost everything.</td>
				<td><img src="Titans/jaw.jpg" style="width: 45%; float:center-right; display: block;"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Cart Titan</td>
				<td>The Cart Titan is mainly used for utility. It is a quadrupedal and usually carries items on its back. The Cart Titan is known for its endurance allowing the user to stay in titan form for months and can transform multiple times a day in rapid succession. Its speed is only second to the Jaw Titan.</td>
				<td><img src="Titans/cart.jpg" style="width: 45%; float:center-right; display: block;"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>War Hammer Titan </td>
				<td>The inheritor of the War Hammer Titan can use its hardened flesh to materialize objects and structures. Its user can also encase its human form in crystal while controlling its titan form from afar.</td>
				<td><img src="Titans/war.jpg" style="width: 45%; float:center-right; display: block;"></td>
