			  <h3>Setting</h3>
			  <img src="walls.png" style="width: 25%; float:right; display: block;">
			  <p>Attack on Titan takes place in a German-inspired civilization set inside three circular, concentric walls: Wall Maria, Wall Rose, Wall Sina, respectively. Its population has been led to believe that over a century ago, humanity took refuge inside these walls after being driven to the brink of extinction. This threat was caused by titans, gigantic beings that somewhat resembled humans who attack and devour humans on sight. The country’s military developed omnidirectional gear, a piece of technology that allows its users to propel at immense speeds in three dimensions to combat said, titans. The story follows Eren Yaeger, a young boy from the Shiganshina district which is located on the outermost area of the three walls. After more than a hundred years of living in peace, humanity was once again reminded of the threat that titans bring after the Colossal Titan and Armored Titan breached the gates of Shiganshina District and Wall Maria respectively. Due to flying rubble caused by the breach, a large boulder crippled Eren’s mom and he witnessed her getting caught and eaten by a titan. From then on, Eren swore to seek revenge by killing all titans.</p>
